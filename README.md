# Applications of Tensorflow
This project is to demostrate the applications of tensorflow.
Three applications are currently included in the project, including
1. use DNN (deep neural network) to perform geo-simulation
2. use CNN (convolutional neural network) to recongize object
3. use built-in gradient descent algorithms to maximize log-likelihood with user-defined penalty functions
